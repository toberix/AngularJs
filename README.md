# KiltedViking/Coursera
This repository contains my solutions to assignments on Coursera courses below.

* Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS

View as webpage at https://kiltedviking.github.io/Coursera/, i.e. run applications 
(assignments) instead of viewing code. ;-)

## Run examples using frameworks (files) on local computer

I generally start developing using local versions of frameworks, i.e. downloading 
files to my computer. Then I switch to CDN versions of frameworks, i.e. to try to
save bandwidth by hoping that visitor already have downloaded frameworks. ;-)

* Install Bower (using `npm i -g bower`), if not already installed.
* In main folder (`Coursera`), run `bower install` to install Bower packages (AngularJS and Bootstrap).
* Uncomment references to local versions of frameworks - both CSS and JS files - in HTML files.
* Comment out (or remove) references to CDN versions of frameworks - (also) in HTML files.
